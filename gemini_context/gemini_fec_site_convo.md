Yes, that is an absolutely perfect plan. Using Svelte (via SvelteKit) with GitHub Actions and GitHub Pages is a modern, powerful, and cost-free way to achieve exactly what you want. Your instincts are spot on.

This workflow is highly recommended because it automates the entire process, from data acquisition to deployment, leaving you with zero server maintenance.

Here is a step-by-step guide to setting this up.

### **\#\# Step 1: Set Up Your SvelteKit Project for GitHub Pages**

First, you need to configure your SvelteKit project to output a static site compatible with GitHub Pages.1

1. **Install adapter-static**: This SvelteKit adapter pre-renders your entire site into a collection of static files.2

   Bash  
   npm i \-D @sveltejs/adapter-static

2. **Configure svelte.config.js**: Update this file to use the static adapter. You'll also need to set the correct paths for GitHub Pages, which usually serves from a subdirectory if it's not a root domain.3

   JavaScript  
   // svelte.config.js  
   import adapter from '@sveltejs/adapter-static';

   const dev \= process.argv.includes('dev');

   /\*\* @type {import('@sveltejs/kit').Config} \*/  
   const config \= {  
       kit: {  
           adapter: adapter({  
               pages: 'build', // where to output the static files  
               assets: 'build',  
               fallback: null,  
               precompress: false  
           }),  
           paths: {  
               base: dev ? '' : '/your-repo-name' // IMPORTANT for GitHub Pages  
           }  
       }  
   };

   export default config;

   **Crucially, you must replace /your-repo-name with the actual name of your GitHub repository.**  
3. **Store Your Data**: Create a directory for your data to live. A common practice is to place your generated JSON files in the static/data directory. For example: static/data/summary.json.  
4. **Load Data in Svelte**: In any Svelte page, you can now fetch this local JSON file.  
   HTML  
   \<script\>  
     import { onMount } from 'svelte';

     let campaignData \= null;

     onMount(async () \=\> {  
       // The base path is handled automatically by SvelteKit  
       const response \= await fetch('/data/summary.json');  
       campaignData \= await response.json();  
     });  
   \</script\>

   \<h1\>Campaign Finance Data\</h1\>  
   {\#if campaignData}  
     \<pre\>{JSON.stringify(campaignData, null, 2)}\</pre\>  
   {:else}  
     \<p\>Loading data...\</p\>  
   {/if}

### **\#\# Step 2: Create the Python Scraping Script**

This is the script that GitHub Actions will run.

1. **Create the Script**: In your project root, create a directory like /scripts and place your Python script inside it (e.g., /scripts/fetch\_data.py). This script should:  
   * Scrape or fetch data from the FEC.  
   * Perform analysis using Pandas.  
   * Save the final, clean data into the static/data/ directory, overwriting the old files.  
2. **Create a requirements.txt**: List the Python libraries your script needs.  
   Plaintext  
   \# scripts/requirements.txt  
   pandas  
   requests  
   beautifulsoup4

### **\#\# Step 3: Automate Everything with GitHub Actions**

This is the magic that ties it all together. You'll create a workflow file that runs on a schedule.

1. **Create the Workflow File**: Create the directory .github/workflows/ in your project root. Inside, create a file named deploy.yml.  
2. **Write the Workflow**: Paste the following configuration into deploy.yml. Read the comments to understand what each step does.  
   YAML  
   \# .github/workflows/deploy.yml  
   name: Build and Deploy Data Site

   on:  
     \# Run automatically every day at 08:00 UTC  
     schedule:  
       \- cron: '0 8 \* \* \*'  
     \# Allow you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab  
     workflow\_dispatch:  
     \# Also run on pushes to the main branch  
     push:  
       branches:  
         \- main

   jobs:  
     build-and-deploy:  
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest  
       permissions:  
         contents: write \# Allows the action to commit changes to the repo  
         pages: write    \# Allows the action to deploy to GitHub Pages  
         id-token: write \# Required for deployment authentication

       steps:  
         \- name: 1. Checkout Repository  
           uses: actions/checkout@v4

         \- name: 2. Setup Python  
           uses: actions/setup-python@v5  
           with:  
             python-version: '3.11'

         \- name: 3. Install Python Dependencies  
           run: pip install \-r ./scripts/requirements.txt

         \- name: 4. Run Scraper to Generate Fresh Data  
           run: python ./scripts/fetch\_data.py

         \- name: 5. Commit Updated Data Files  
           run: |  
             git config \--global user.name 'GitHub Actions Bot'  
             git config \--global user.email 'github-actions\[bot\]@users.noreply.github.com'  
             git add \-A  
             git diff-index \--quiet HEAD || git commit \-m "Update FEC data" && git push

         \- name: 6. Setup Node.js  
           uses: actions/setup-node@v4  
           with:  
             node-version: '20'

         \- name: 7. Install JS Dependencies & Build Site  
           run: |  
             npm install  
             npm run build

         \- name: 8. Setup GitHub Pages  
           uses: actions/configure-pages@v5

         \- name: 9. Upload Artifact  
           uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3  
           with:  
             path: './build'

         \- name: 10. Deploy to GitHub Pages  
           id: deployment  
           uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4

### **\#\# Final Step: Configure Repository Settings**

1. Go to your GitHub repository's **Settings** \> **Pages**.  
2. Under "Build and deployment", set the **Source** to **GitHub Actions**.

That's it. Now, your GitHub Action will run on the schedule you defined, automatically update your data, commit it, rebuild your SvelteKit site with that new data, and deploy the result to GitHub Pages. You have a fully automated, self-updating, static website.
